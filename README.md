SafeSpace is an AI tool developed to help women and girls recognize and respond to online harassment. By using the cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-offensive model, the tool evaluates messages for potentially harmful content and classifies them as either "Harassment" or "Safe." Firebase integration enables user authentication and stores reports for further analysis, ensuring data security. The tool empowers women to stand up to online harassment, offering safety resources and providing support. By leveraging AI, SafeSpace works towards gender equality by making it easier for women and girls to safely engage with online spaces, thereby reducing the gender disparities present in digital interactions.
